Fiar Is Another ROM

Fiar is a minimal x86 ROM which is in charge of loading FSBL (first stage
boot loader) and execute it.

Right now it has only support for minnomax board
https://minnowboard.org/minnowboard-max
And bochs emulator
http://bochs.sourceforge.net/
Zybo board
https://www.xilinx.com/support/university/boards-portfolio/xup-boards/DigilentZYBO.html

# to compile the code
make TARGET=<target> clean all

Where <target> can be minnowmax or bochs. If no target is passed the default
one is minnowmax

Make sure you use the right cross compile when building for zybo.
e.g
CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- make USE_CLANG=0 TARGET=zybo clean all
